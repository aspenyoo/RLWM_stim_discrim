# Lowered inter-stimulus discriminability hurts incremental, but not working memory-dependent contributions to learning


Here is a brief description of the folders. Each folder has a README file to further explain its contents. 

- **anova.R**: contains the code to conduct the ANOVAs reported in the manuscript
- **helper_functions/**: contains various functions used to fit, plot, and otherwise wrangle the data.
- **models/**: contains functions to fit models
- **analysis_scripts.m**: contains example code for how to collect and fit data, as well as code used to analyze model fits and generate figures. 
- **plot_figures.m**: contains code to fit all figures found in the main manuscript as well as the Supplementary Materials. 

Human and simulated data, as well as fits, can be found at https://osf.io/f4hst/.
